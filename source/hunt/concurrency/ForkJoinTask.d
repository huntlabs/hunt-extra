/**
 * Abstract base class for tasks that run within a {@link ForkJoinPool}.
 * A {@code ForkJoinTask} is a thread-like entity that is much
 * lighter weight than a normal thread.  Huge numbers of tasks and
 * subtasks may be hosted by a small number of actual threads in a
 * ForkJoinPool, at the price of some usage limitations.
 *
 * <p>A "main" {@code ForkJoinTask} begins execution when it is
 * explicitly submitted to a {@link ForkJoinPool}, or, if not already
 * engaged in a ForkJoin computation, commenced in the {@link
 * ForkJoinPool#commonPool()} via {@link #fork}, {@link #invoke}, or
 * related methods.  Once started, it will usually in turn start other
 * subtasks.  As indicated by the name of this class, many programs
 * using {@code ForkJoinTask} employ only methods {@link #fork} and
 * {@link #join}, or derivatives such as {@link
 * #invokeAll(ForkJoinTask...) invokeAll}.  However, this class also
 * provides a number of other methods that can come into play in
 * advanced usages, as well as extension mechanics that allow support
 * of new forms of fork/join processing.
 *
 * <p>A {@code ForkJoinTask} is a lightweight form of {@link Future}.
 * The efficiency of {@code ForkJoinTask}s stems from a set of
 * restrictions (that are only partially statically enforceable)
 * reflecting their main use as computational tasks calculating pure
 * functions or operating on purely isolated objects.  The primary
 * coordination mechanisms are {@link #fork}, that arranges
 * asynchronous execution, and {@link #join}, that doesn't proceed
 * until the task's result has been computed.  Computations should
 * ideally avoid {@code synchronized} methods or blocks, and should
 * minimize other blocking synchronization apart from joining other
 * tasks or using synchronizers such as Phasers that are advertised to
 * cooperate with fork/join scheduling. Subdividable tasks should also
 * not perform blocking I/O, and should ideally access variables that
 * are completely independent of those accessed by other running
 * tasks. These guidelines are loosely enforced by not permitting
 * checked exceptions such as {@code IOExceptions} to be
 * thrown. However, computations may still encounter unchecked
 * exceptions, that are rethrown to callers attempting to join
 * them. These exceptions may additionally include {@link
 * RejectedExecutionException} stemming from internal resource
 * exhaustion, such as failure to allocate internal task
 * queues. Rethrown exceptions behave in the same way as regular
 * exceptions, but, when possible, contain stack traces (as displayed
 * for example using {@code ex.printStackTrace()}) of both the thread
 * that initiated the computation as well as the thread actually
 * encountering the exception; minimally only the latter.
 *
 * <p>It is possible to define and use ForkJoinTasks that may block,
 * but doing so requires three further considerations: (1) Completion
 * of few if any <em>other</em> tasks should be dependent on a task
 * that blocks on external synchronization or I/O. Event-style async
 * tasks that are never joined (for example, those subclassing {@link
 * CountedCompleter}) often fall into this category.  (2) To minimize
 * resource impact, tasks should be small; ideally performing only the
 * (possibly) blocking action. (3) Unless the {@link
 * ForkJoinPool.ManagedBlocker} API is used, or the number of possibly
 * blocked tasks is known to be less than the pool's {@link
 * ForkJoinPool#getParallelism} level, the pool cannot guarantee that
 * enough threads will be available to ensure progress or good
 * performance.
 *
 * <p>The primary method for awaiting completion and extracting
 * results of a task is {@link #join}, but there are several variants:
 * The {@link Future#get} methods support interruptible and/or timed
 * waits for completion and report results using {@code Future}
 * conventions. Method {@link #invoke} is semantically
 * equivalent to {@code fork(); join()} but always attempts to begin
 * execution in the current thread. The "<em>quiet</em>" forms of
 * these methods do not extract results or report exceptions. These
 * may be useful when a set of tasks are being executed, and you need
 * to delay processing of results or exceptions until all complete.
 * Method {@code invokeAll} (available in multiple versions)
 * performs the most common form of parallel invocation: forking a set
 * of tasks and joining them all.
 *
 * <p>In the most typical usages, a fork-join pair act like a call
 * (fork) and return (join) from a parallel recursive function. As is
 * the case with other forms of recursive calls, returns (joins)
 * should be performed innermost-first. For example, {@code a.fork();
 * b.fork(); b.join(); a.join();} is likely to be substantially more
 * efficient than joining {@code a} before {@code b}.
 *
 * <p>The execution status of tasks may be queried at several levels
 * of detail: {@link #isDone} is true if a task completed in any way
 * (including the case where a task was cancelled without executing);
 * {@link #isCompletedNormally} is true if a task completed without
 * cancellation or encountering an exception; {@link #isCancelled} is
 * true if the task was cancelled (in which case {@link #getException}
 * returns a {@link CancellationException}); and
 * {@link #isCompletedAbnormally} is true if a task was either
 * cancelled or encountered an exception, in which case {@link
 * #getException} will return either the encountered exception or
 * {@link CancellationException}.
 *
 * <p>The ForkJoinTask class is not usually directly subclassed.
 * Instead, you subclass one of the abstract classes that support a
 * particular style of fork/join processing, typically {@link
 * RecursiveAction} for most computations that do not return results,
 * {@link RecursiveTask} for those that do, and {@link
 * CountedCompleter} for those in which completed actions trigger
 * other actions.  Normally, a concrete ForkJoinTask subclass declares
 * fields comprising its parameters, established in a constructor, and
 * then defines a {@code compute} method that somehow uses the control
 * methods supplied by this base class.
 *
 * <p>Method {@link #join} and its variants are appropriate for use
 * only when completion dependencies are acyclic; that is, the
 * parallel computation can be described as a directed acyclic graph
 * (DAG). Otherwise, executions may encounter a form of deadlock as
 * tasks cyclically wait for each other.  However, this framework
 * supports other methods and techniques (for example the use of
 * {@link Phaser}, {@link #helpQuiesce}, and {@link #complete}) that
 * may be of use in constructing custom subclasses for problems that
 * are not statically structured as DAGs. To support such usages, a
 * ForkJoinTask may be atomically <em>tagged</em> with a {@code short}
 * value using {@link #setForkJoinTaskTag} or {@link
 * #compareAndSetForkJoinTaskTag} and checked using {@link
 * #getForkJoinTaskTag}. The ForkJoinTask implementation does not use
 * these {@code protected} methods or tags for any purpose, but they
 * may be of use in the construction of specialized subclasses.  For
 * example, parallel graph traversals can use the supplied methods to
 * avoid revisiting nodes/tasks that have already been processed.
 * (Method names for tagging are bulky in part to encourage definition
 * of methods that reflect their usage patterns.)
 *
 * <p>Most base support methods are {@code final}, to prevent
 * overriding of implementations that are intrinsically tied to the
 * underlying lightweight task scheduling framework.  Developers
 * creating new basic styles of fork/join processing should minimally
 * implement {@code protected} methods {@link #exec}, {@link
 * #setRawResult}, and {@link #getRawResult}, while also introducing
 * an abstract computational method that can be implemented in its
 * subclasses, possibly relying on other {@code protected} methods
 * provided by this class.
 *
 * <p>ForkJoinTasks should perform relatively small amounts of
 * computation. Large tasks should be split into smaller subtasks,
 * usually via recursive decomposition. As a very rough rule of thumb,
 * a task should perform more than 100 and less than 10000 basic
 * computational steps, and should avoid indefinite looping. If tasks
 * are too big, then parallelism cannot improve throughput. If too
 * small, then memory and internal task maintenance overhead may
 * overwhelm processing.
 *
 * <p>This class provides {@code adapt} methods for {@link Runnable}
 * and {@link Callable}, that may be of use when mixing execution of
 * {@code ForkJoinTasks} with other kinds of tasks. When all tasks are
 * of this form, consider using a pool constructed in <em>asyncMode</em>.
 *
 * <p>ForkJoinTasks are {@code Serializable}, which enables them to be
 * used in extensions such as remote execution frameworks. It is
 * sensible to serialize tasks only before or after, but not during,
 * execution. Serialization is not relied on during execution itself.

}

/**
 * A {@link ForkJoinTask} with a completion action performed when
 * triggered and there are no remaining pending actions.
 * CountedCompleters are in general more robust in the
 * presence of subtask stalls and blockage than are other forms of
 * ForkJoinTasks, but are less intuitive to program.  Uses of
 * CountedCompleter are similar to those of other completion based
 * components (such as {@link java.nio.channels.CompletionHandler})
 * except that multiple <em>pending</em> completions may be necessary
 * to trigger the completion action {@link #onCompletion(CountedCompleter)},
 * not just one.
 * Unless initialized otherwise, the {@linkplain #getPendingCount pending
 * count} starts at zero, but may be (atomically) changed using
 * methods {@link #setPendingCount}, {@link #addToPendingCount}, and
 * {@link #compareAndSetPendingCount}. Upon invocation of {@link
 * #tryComplete}, if the pending action count is nonzero, it is
 * decremented; otherwise, the completion action is performed, and if
 * this completer itself has a completer, the process is continued
 * with its completer.  As is the case with related synchronization
 * components such as {@link Phaser} and {@link Semaphore}, these methods
 * affect only internal counts; they do not establish any further
 * internal bookkeeping. In particular, the identities of pending
 * tasks are not maintained. As illustrated below, you can create
 * subclasses that do record some or all pending tasks or their
 * results when needed.  As illustrated below, utility methods
 * supporting customization of completion traversals are also
 * provided. However, because CountedCompleters provide only basic
 * synchronization mechanisms, it may be useful to create further
 * abstract subclasses that maintain linkages, fields, and additional
 * support methods appropriate for a set of related usages.
 *
 * <p>A concrete CountedCompleter class must define method {@link
 * #compute}, that should in most cases (as illustrated below), invoke
 * {@code tryComplete()} once before returning. The class may also
 * optionally override method {@link #onCompletion(CountedCompleter)}
 * to perform an action upon normal completion, and method
 * {@link #onExceptionalCompletion(Throwable, CountedCompleter)} to
 * perform an action upon any exception.
 *
 * <p>CountedCompleters most often do not bear results, in which case
 * they are normally declared as {@code CountedCompleter!(void)}, and
 * will always return {@code null} as a result value.  In other cases,
 * you should override method {@link #getRawResult} to provide a
 * result from {@code join(), invoke()}, and related methods.  In
 * general, this method should return the value of a field (or a
 * function of one or more fields) of the CountedCompleter object that
 * holds the result upon completion. Method {@link #setRawResult} by
 * default plays no role in CountedCompleters.  It is possible, but
 * rarely applicable, to override this method to maintain other
 * objects or fields holding result data.
 *
 * <p>A CountedCompleter that does not itself have a completer (i.e.,
 * one for which {@link #getCompleter} returns {@code null}) can be
 * used as a regular ForkJoinTask with this added functionality.
 * However, any completer that in turn has another completer serves
 * only as an internal helper for other computations, so its own task
 * status (as reported in methods such as {@link ForkJoinTask#isDone})
 * is arbitrary; this status changes only upon explicit invocations of
 * {@link #complete}, {@link ForkJoinTask#cancel},
 * {@link ForkJoinTask#completeExceptionally(Throwable)} or upon
 * exceptional completion of method {@code compute}. Upon any
 * exceptional completion, the exception may be relayed to a task's
 * completer (and its completer, and so on), if one exists and it has
 * not otherwise already completed. Similarly, cancelling an internal
 * CountedCompleter has only a local effect on that completer, so is
 * not often useful.
 *
 * <p><b>Sample Usages.</b>
 *
 * <p><b>Parallel recursive decomposition.</b> CountedCompleters may
 * be arranged in trees similar to those often used with {@link
 * RecursiveAction}s, although the constructions involved in setting
 * them up typically vary. Here, the completer of each task is its
 * parent in the computation tree. Even though they entail a bit more
 * bookkeeping, CountedCompleters may be better choices when applying
 * a possibly time-consuming operation (that cannot be further
 * subdivided) to each element of an array or collection; especially
 * when the operation takes a significantly different amount of time
 * to complete for some elements than others, either because of
 * intrinsic variation (for example I/O) or auxiliary effects such as
 * garbage collection.  Because CountedCompleters provide their own
 * continuations, other tasks need not block waiting to perform them.
 *
 * <p>For example, here is an initial version of a utility method that
 * uses divide-by-two recursive decomposition to divide work into
 * single pieces (leaf tasks). Even when work is split into individual
 * calls, tree-based techniques are usually preferable to directly
 * forking leaf tasks, because they reduce inter-thread communication
 * and improve load balancing. In the recursive case, the second of
 * each pair of subtasks to finish triggers completion of their parent
 * (because no result combination is performed, the default no-op
 * implementation of method {@code onCompletion} is not overridden).
 * The utility method sets up the root task and invokes it (here,
 * implicitly using the {@link ForkJoinPool#commonPool()}).  It is
 * straightforward and reliable (but not optimal) to always set the
 * pending count to the number of child tasks and call {@code
 * tryComplete()} immediately before returning.
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * static <E> void forEach(E[] array, Consumer<E> action) {
 *   class Task extends CountedCompleter!(void) {
 *     final int lo, hi;
 *     Task(Task parent, int lo, int hi) {
 *       super(parent); this.lo = lo; this.hi = hi;
 *     }
 *
 *     void compute() {
 *       if (hi - lo >= 2) {
 *         int mid = (lo + hi) >>> 1;
 *         // must set pending count before fork
 *         setPendingCount(2);
 *         new Task(this, mid, hi).fork(); // right child
 *         new Task(this, lo, mid).fork(); // left child
 *       }
 *       else if (hi > lo)
 *         action.accept(array[lo]);
 *       tryComplete();
 *     }
 *   }
 *   new Task(null, 0, array.length).invoke();
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * This design can be improved by noticing that in the recursive case,
 * the task has nothing to do after forking its right task, so can
 * directly invoke its left task before returning. (This is an analog
 * of tail recursion removal.)  Also, when the last action in a task
 * is to fork or invoke a subtask (a "tail call"), the call to {@code
 * tryComplete()} can be optimized away, at the cost of making the
 * pending count look "off by one".
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 *     void compute() {
 *       if (hi - lo >= 2) {
 *         int mid = (lo + hi) >>> 1;
 *         setPendingCount(1); // looks off by one, but correct!

 *         new Task(this, lo, mid).compute(); // direct invoke
 *       } else {
 *         if (hi > lo)
 *           action.accept(array[lo]);
 *         tryComplete();
 *       }
 *     }}</pre>
 *
 * As a further optimization, notice that the left task need not even exist.
 * Instead of creating a new one, we can continue using the original task,
 * and add a pending count for each fork.  Additionally, because no task
 * in this tree implements an {@link #onCompletion(CountedCompleter)} method,
 * {@code tryComplete} can be replaced with {@link #propagateCompletion}.
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 *     void compute() {
 *       int n = hi - lo;
 *       for (; n >= 2; n /= 2) {
 *         addToPendingCount(1);
 *         new Task(this, lo + n/2, lo + n).fork();
 *       }
 *       if (n > 0)
 *         action.accept(array[lo]);
 *       propagateCompletion();
 *     }}</pre>
 *
 * When pending counts can be precomputed, they can be established in
 * the constructor:
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * static <E> void forEach(E[] array, Consumer<E> action) {
 *   class Task extends CountedCompleter!(void) {
 *     final int lo, hi;
 *     Task(Task parent, int lo, int hi) {
 *       super(parent, 31 - Integer.numberOfLeadingZeros(hi - lo));
 *       this.lo = lo; this.hi = hi;
 *     }
 *
 *     void compute() {
 *       for (int n = hi - lo; n >= 2; n /= 2)
 *         new Task(this, lo + n/2, lo + n).fork();
 *       action.accept(array[lo]);
 *       propagateCompletion();
 *     }
 *   }
 *   if (array.length > 0)
 *     new Task(null, 0, array.length).invoke();
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * Additional optimizations of such classes might entail specializing
 * classes for leaf steps, subdividing by say, four, instead of two
 * per iteration, and using an adaptive threshold instead of always
 * subdividing down to single elements.
 *
 * <p><b>Searching.</b> A tree of CountedCompleters can search for a
 * value or property in different parts of a data structure, and
 * report a result in an {@link
 * hunt.concurrency.atomic.AtomicReference AtomicReference} as
 * soon as one is found. The others can poll the result to avoid
 * unnecessary work. (You could additionally {@linkplain #cancel
 * cancel} other tasks, but it is usually simpler and more efficient
 * to just let them notice that the result is set and if so skip
 * further processing.)  Illustrating again with an array using full
 * partitioning (again, in practice, leaf tasks will almost always
 * process more than one element):
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * class Searcher<E> extends CountedCompleter<E> {
 *   final E[] array; final AtomicReference<E> result; final int lo, hi;
 *   Searcher(ICountedCompleter p, E[] array, AtomicReference<E> result, int lo, int hi) {
 *     super(p);
 *     this.array = array; this.result = result; this.lo = lo; this.hi = hi;
 *   }
 *   E getRawResult() { return result.get(); }
 *   void compute() { // similar to ForEach version 3
 *     int l = lo, h = hi;
 *     while (result.get() is null && h >= l) {
 *       if (h - l >= 2) {
 *         int mid = (l + h) >>> 1;
 *         addToPendingCount(1);
 *         new Searcher(this, array, result, mid, h).fork();
 *         h = mid;
 *       }
 *       else {
 *         E x = array[l];
 *         if (matches(x) && result.compareAndSet(null, x))
 *           quietlyCompleteRoot(); // root task is now joinable
 *         break;
 *       }
 *     }
 *     tryComplete(); // normally complete whether or not found
 *   }
 *   bool matches(E e) { ... } // return true if found
 *
 *   static <E> E search(E[] array) {
 *       return new Searcher<E>(null, array, new AtomicReference<E>(), 0, array.length).invoke();
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * In this example, as well as others in which tasks have no other
 * effects except to {@code compareAndSet} a common result, the
 * trailing unconditional invocation of {@code tryComplete} could be
 * made conditional ({@code if (result.get() is null) tryComplete();})
 * because no further bookkeeping is required to manage completions
 * once the root task completes.
 *
 * <p><b>Recording subtasks.</b> CountedCompleter tasks that combine
 * results of multiple subtasks usually need to access these results
 * in method {@link #onCompletion(CountedCompleter)}. As illustrated in the following
 * class (that performs a simplified form of map-reduce where mappings
 * and reductions are all of type {@code E}), one way to do this in
 * divide and conquer designs is to have each subtask record its
 * sibling, so that it can be accessed in method {@code onCompletion}.
 * This technique applies to reductions in which the order of
 * combining left and right results does not matter; ordered
 * reductions require explicit left/right designations.  Variants of
 * other streamlinings seen in the above examples may also apply.
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * class MyMapper<E> { E apply(E v) {  ...  } }
 * class MyReducer<E> { E apply(E x, E y) {  ...  } }
 * class MapReducer<E> extends CountedCompleter<E> {
 *   final E[] array; final MyMapper<E> mapper;
 *   final MyReducer<E> reducer; final int lo, hi;
 *   MapReducer<E> sibling;
 *   E result;
 *   MapReducer(ICountedCompleter p, E[] array, MyMapper<E> mapper,
 *              MyReducer<E> reducer, int lo, int hi) {
 *     super(p);
 *     this.array = array; this.mapper = mapper;
 *     this.reducer = reducer; this.lo = lo; this.hi = hi;
 *   }
 *   void compute() {
 *     if (hi - lo >= 2) {
 *       int mid = (lo + hi) >>> 1;
 *       MapReducer<E> left = new MapReducer(this, array, mapper, reducer, lo, mid);
 *       MapReducer<E> right = new MapReducer(this, array, mapper, reducer, mid, hi);
 *       left.sibling = right;
 *       right.sibling = left;
 *       setPendingCount(1); // only right is pending
 *       right.fork();
 *       left.compute();     // directly execute left
 *     }
 *     else {
 *       if (hi > lo)
 *           result = mapper.apply(array[lo]);
 *       tryComplete();
 *     }
 *   }
 *   void onCompletion(ICountedCompleter caller) {
 *     if (caller != this) {
 *       MapReducer<E> child = (MapReducer<E>)caller;
 *       MapReducer<E> sib = child.sibling;
 *       if (sib is null || sib.result is null)
 *         result = child.result;
 *       else
 *         result = reducer.apply(child.result, sib.result);
 *     }
 *   }
 *   E getRawResult() { return result; }
 *
 *   static <E> E mapReduce(E[] array, MyMapper<E> mapper, MyReducer<E> reducer) {
 *     return new MapReducer<E>(null, array, mapper, reducer,
 *                              0, array.length).invoke();
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * Here, method {@code onCompletion} takes a form common to many
 * completion designs that combine results. This callback-style method
 * is triggered once per task, in either of the two different contexts
 * in which the pending count is, or becomes, zero: (1) by a task
 * itself, if its pending count is zero upon invocation of {@code
 * tryComplete}, or (2) by any of its subtasks when they complete and
 * decrement the pending count to zero. The {@code caller} argument
 * distinguishes cases.  Most often, when the caller is {@code this},
 * no action is necessary. Otherwise the caller argument can be used
 * (usually via a cast) to supply a value (and/or links to other
 * values) to be combined.  Assuming proper use of pending counts, the
 * actions inside {@code onCompletion} occur (once) upon completion of
 * a task and its subtasks. No additional synchronization is required
 * within this method to ensure thread safety of accesses to fields of
 * this task or other completed tasks.
 *
 * <p><b>Completion Traversals</b>. If using {@code onCompletion} to
 * process completions is inapplicable or inconvenient, you can use
 * methods {@link #firstComplete} and {@link #nextComplete} to create
 * custom traversals.  For example, to define a MapReducer that only
 * splits out right-hand tasks in the form of the third ForEach
 * example, the completions must cooperatively reduce along
 * unexhausted subtask links, which can be done as follows:
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * class MapReducer<E> extends CountedCompleter<E> { // version 2
 *   final E[] array; final MyMapper<E> mapper;
 *   final MyReducer<E> reducer; final int lo, hi;
 *   MapReducer<E> forks, next; // record subtask forks in list
 *   E result;
 *   MapReducer(ICountedCompleter p, E[] array, MyMapper<E> mapper,
 *              MyReducer<E> reducer, int lo, int hi, MapReducer<E> next) {
 *     super(p);
 *     this.array = array; this.mapper = mapper;
 *     this.reducer = reducer; this.lo = lo; this.hi = hi;
 *     this.next = next;
 *   }
 *   void compute() {
 *     int l = lo, h = hi;
 *     while (h - l >= 2) {
 *       int mid = (l + h) >>> 1;
 *       addToPendingCount(1);
 *       (forks = new MapReducer(this, array, mapper, reducer, mid, h, forks)).fork();
 *       h = mid;
 *     }
 *     if (h > l)
 *       result = mapper.apply(array[l]);
 *     // process completions by reducing along and advancing subtask links
 *     for (ICountedCompleter c = firstComplete(); c !is null; c = c.nextComplete()) {
 *       for (MapReducer t = (MapReducer)c, s = t.forks; s !is null; s = t.forks = s.next)
 *         t.result = reducer.apply(t.result, s.result);
 *     }
 *   }
 *   E getRawResult() { return result; }
 *
 *   static <E> E mapReduce(E[] array, MyMapper<E> mapper, MyReducer<E> reducer) {
 *     return new MapReducer<E>(null, array, mapper, reducer,
 *                              0, array.length, null).invoke();
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Triggers.</b> Some CountedCompleters are themselves never
 * forked, but instead serve as bits of plumbing in other designs;
 * including those in which the completion of one or more async tasks
 * triggers another async task. For example:
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * class HeaderBuilder extends CountedCompleter<...> { ... }
 * class BodyBuilder extends CountedCompleter<...> { ... }
 * class PacketSender extends CountedCompleter<...> {
 *   PacketSender(...) { super(null, 1); ... } // trigger on second completion
 *   void compute() { } // never called
 *   void onCompletion(ICountedCompleter caller) { sendPacket(); }
 * }
 * // sample use:
 * PacketSender p = new PacketSender();
 * new HeaderBuilder(p, ...).fork();
 * new BodyBuilder(p, ...).fork();}</pre>

/**
 * A recursive result-bearing {@link ForkJoinTask}.

 * <p>For a classic example, here is a task computing Fibonacci numbers:
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * class Fibonacci extends RecursiveTask<Integer> {
 *   final int n;
 *   Fibonacci(int n) { this.n = n; }
 *   protected Integer compute() {
 *     if (n <= 1)

 *     f1.fork();
 *     Fibonacci f2 = new Fibonacci(n - 2);
 *     return f2.compute() + f1.join();
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * However, besides being a dumb way to compute Fibonacci functions
 * (there is a simple fast linear algorithm that you'd use in
 * practice), this is likely to perform poorly because the smallest
 * subtasks are too small to be worthwhile splitting up. Instead, as
 * is the case for nearly all fork/join applications, you'd pick some
 * minimum granularity size (for example 10 here) for which you always
 * sequentially solve rather than subdividing.
